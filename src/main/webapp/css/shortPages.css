/*
this is almost identical css to the styles.css sheet except the footer's position is absolute
this is because on the pages that don't span the whole length of the page the footer was awkwardly placed and looked bad
when using absolute positioning on the pages that were longer than the length of the screen it would stay
in the middle of the screen and block content, it was ugly :/
